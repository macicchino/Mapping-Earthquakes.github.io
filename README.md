## Overview of the analysis:
  - Using geoJSON, d.3, and leaflet tools among others I was able to display JSON data from public sources. In doing so, practiced using html,js, and css in conjunction with a live server. I also practiced quality testing and bug fixes using the console of the webportal. 

## Additional Notes:
  - I believe the bootstap and mapbox tool are extremely stylish, I plan to use in the future!
